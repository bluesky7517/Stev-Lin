Exercise is just like breath in my life <br>
love that alive feeling after WOD. <br>

Through the CrossFit I feel I’m stronger and fit, but more importantly, <br> I feel like I have become a  more open and positive person.<br> CrossFit has also given me a second family. I’m proud of becoming a CrossFiter.<br>
